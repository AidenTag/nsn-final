# Neural Safety Net Final Project

Research has explored the data traits that mitigate the tradeoff between accuracy and robustness. We want to experimentally determine which attributes of the model's architecture are important for training models that exhibit natural adversarial robustness or are particularly receptive to adversarial training without severely comprimising accuracy.
